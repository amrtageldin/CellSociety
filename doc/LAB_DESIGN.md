# Cell Society Design Discussion
### Team Number: 9 
### Names: Reya Magan, Amr Tagel-Din, Luke Josephy, Evelyn Cupil-Garcia


### Discussion Questions

 * __How does a Cell know what rules to apply for its simulation?__
    
   We are planning to have an abstract rules class that each rule type will extend. We are planning to have a model superclass that each game extends for its own model.

 * __How does a Cell know about its neighbors?__

 * __How can a Cell update itself without affecting its neighbors update?__

 * __What behaviors does the Grid itself have?__

 * __How can a Grid update all the Cells it contains?__

 * __How is configuration information used to set up a simulation?__

 * __How is the GUI updated after all the cells have been updated?__
